    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
            <li>
                Make the rice: Heat a large skillet over medium-high. Add 1 tablespoon butter, and then onion and carrot.<br>
                Cook, stirring, until onion is translucent and a little browned at the edges, about 3 minutes. Add ham <br>
                and cook, stirring, until it begins to brown, about 30 seconds.<br></li><br>
            <li>Add remaining 1 tablespoon butter, and then rice, breaking it up with a wooden spoon or long chopsticks.<br>
                Adjust heat to medium and cook until the grains are glossy, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in ketchup and soy sauce,<br>
                and cook, stirring, another 30 seconds or so to caramelize. Stir in peas to heat through, and deglaze the<br>
                pan with dashi or chicken stock. Remove from heat and season to taste with salt and pepper.<br></li><br>
            <li>To make a perfect mound of rice on each plate, grease a small bowl with canola or safflower oil and pack<br>
                 1 cup of the rice. Invert this over a plate and remove the bowl. Repeat with the other half of the rice <br>
                 on a second plate.<br></li><br>

            <li>Make the omelet: In a small (6- or 7-inch) nonstick skillet (or a well-seasoned carbon steel omelet pan),<br>
                 heat ½ teaspoon oil, or just enough to coat the pan, over medium-high. Beat 2 eggs with ½ teaspoon dashi<br>
                 or water, until yolks and whites are completely blended. Season with salt and pepper.<br>
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Pour the egg mixture into the heated pan. Shake and swirl the pan over the heat, stirring constantly with<br>
                 chopsticks or a fork as the eggs cook. When lots of small curds have formed and the eggs are custardy, <br>
                 about 30 seconds, let cook undisturbed until nearly set, about 30 seconds. Run a butter knife or small <br>
                 spatula around the edge of the omelet, and tap the pan firmly against the stove to release the omelet.<br> 
                 Turn the omelet out onto the rice, custardy side down. Use a clean dish towel or paper towel to push the <br>
                 edges under the rice.<br>
            </li><br>
            <li>Repeat with the other 2 eggs for the second omelet. Dress the omelets with a zigzag of ketchup (or a cute<br>
                design if you've got a steady hand), and serve.</li><br>
